Learn Git through practical, step-by-step scenarios that cover real-world situations you'll encounter when working with Git. Each scenario provides detailed instructions, explanations, and warnings to help you understand not just *what* to do, but *why* you're doing it.

## üéØ How to Use This Guide

1. **Browse scenarios** by category or use the search to find specific topics
2. **Check prerequisites** before starting a scenario
3. **Follow steps carefully** - each includes commands, explanations, and context
4. **Pay attention to warnings** - Git can be powerful but dangerous
5. **Practice in a safe environment** first before applying to important projects

## üìö Scenario Categories

- **Commit Management** - Working with commits: combining, undoing, and cherry-picking
- **Branch Management** - Creating, merging, and managing branches
- **Working Directory** - Managing your workspace and temporary changes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Tips

- Always work on a copy or test repository when learning
- Never rewrite history on shared/public repositories
- Keep backups of important work before trying complex operations
- When in doubt, check `git status` and `git log` frequently
